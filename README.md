# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
The project applies data science methodologies and tools acquired in the IBM Data Science professional certification to define and solve a real world business problem for an emerging space company called Space-Y. The company would like to know if it stands any chance of winning government contract to carry payload against Space-X which advertises its falcon 9 launches for around $62 Million compared to most competitions which have a price tag of over $162 Million due to the rocket's re-usability.   
This was primarily accopmplished through predicting if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully based on a publicly available data on the Space-X website.
